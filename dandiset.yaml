description: Trains of 5 different duration pulses,  all exposures were at 1 Hz. Cells
  were electroporated by a train of 5 unipolar 300ns, 600ns, 1200ns, 50us, 100us,
  500us or bipolar 300+300ns, 600+600ns, 1200+1200ns, 50+50us, 100+100us, 500+500us
  pulses (second pulse's amplitude was 50% in relation to the first pulse's amplitude).
  The electrodes were two parallel stainless-steel cylinders, 1.5 mm in diameter and
  3 mm apart. Supported by NIH 1R21EY034258
